These portraits are all lovingly painted by me, Quacken.
I took vanilla portraits in consideration when painting these so they should fit in quite nicely,
thought I do and will occasionally go overboard with detail so, eh. 
It's still pretty and that's all that matters to me.

Enjoy them :)
Will be adding more in future.

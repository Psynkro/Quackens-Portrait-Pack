These portraits are all lovingly painted by me, Quacken.
Someone made a comment on the forums, namely Yunru, about there being not enough ducks.
So here's a duck.

This is a new pack so that I can do more silly portraits as per namesake.
Pleases feel free to send me suggestions. I'd be happy to paint fun stuff and relax for a while.

Enjoy them :)
I'll add more when I have more fun stuff.
